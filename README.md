## Context 
I extended the code from the initial instructor's code during the class. The given requirements were:

- Step no.1> Include a button to prompt users.
- Step no.2> This button initiates two consecutive prompts.
- Step no.3> The prompts enable users to input the name of the assignment and its corresponding grade.
- Step no.4> After collecting both pieces of data, display them on the screen for the respective student.

* Note: Since building logic is more important than making the experience look beautiful, I did not work on CSS.
